# ztf_vissl
Running Facebook VISSL with ZTF image data

Description:
The goal of this project is to train and run Facebookâ€™s VISSL image recognition AI on Zwicky Transient Facility astronomical images.  This is done entirely inside of Jupiter Notebooks using Python and command lines.

Installation and Execution:
To run the code, simply download the notebook and open it in a Jupiter notebook environment (such as Anaconda or Google Collab).  The notebook contains text prompts and descriptions along with the necessary code.

Work to be done:
Currently the notebook does not run properly as VISSL requires standard image formats like jpeg, however, ZTF images are TIFFs.  Code to convert TIFF files to a usable alternative is required to make the code functional. 

Credits:
Thank you Matthew Graham for giving me the opportunity to explore VISSL and ZTF code and images over the Summer of 2021.
